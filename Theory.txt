CSS Flexbox:-
            Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model, designed for arranging items along either the horizontal 
            or vertical axis.
It is primarily used for creating flexible and dynamic layouts in a single row or column.
Provides properties for aligning items along the main axis and cross axis.
Useful for creating responsive designs and handling content with varying sizes.

CSS GRID:--
           CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout model, allowing for both rows and columns simultaneously.
It creates a grid structure where items can be placed explicitly in cells or spans across multiple cells.
Provides precise control over the placement of items in both rows and columns.
Allows you to define explicit grid lines and areas.
